Half a year ago I decided that it would be a good idea to make my own game engine, it's not very useful since it doesn't support dynamic buffer updates yet (but I have done it in the past as well as exponential shadow mapping), it supports my own texture and font file formats, you just have to feed it an std::vector of texture names and it will load them, their mipmaps and create texture2darray, it also has a text class that creates text mesh out of string

For some reason it's like 1gb so I'm not going to share a full project, just code and a screenshot of how it looks
